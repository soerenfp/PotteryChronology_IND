# How to interpret the cluster plot

A cluster plot visually shows the grouping of data points based on their similarity, as defined by the clustering algorithm. Here's how to interpret it:

Key Elements in the Cluster Plot

Data Points (Colored by Cluster):

Each point represents an observation, and its position on the x- and y-axes reflects its values for numeric_category and actual_width.
Points with the same color belong to the same cluster. The color grouping indicates which points are most similar according to the k-means algorithm.

Cluster Centroids (If Plotted):

Cluster centroids represent the center or "average" point of each cluster. These points are typically the mean of all data points within a cluster.
Although centroids aren't shown in the basic plot, adding them can help visualize the center of each cluster and identify how the clusters are spaced relative to each other.

How to Interpret the Plot

Cluster Composition:

Clusters group points that are similar in terms of numeric_category and actual_width. Points within the same cluster should be closer to each other compared to points in different clusters.
Check whether clusters are well-defined or overlapping. Overlapping clusters may indicate that some categories aren’t strongly distinct on these variables, or that the number of clusters (k) may need adjustment.

Cluster Size and Distribution:

If some clusters are much larger or denser than others, this can provide insights into the distribution of your data. Larger clusters may indicate categories with wider variability, while smaller, tightly grouped clusters may suggest high similarity within those clusters.

Outliers:

Isolated points within or outside clusters may be outliers or unique observations that don’t fit well within any group. These points may warrant further investigation to understand why they don’t cluster with others.

Distance Between Clusters:

Clusters with large gaps between them suggest well-separated groups, while closely spaced clusters may indicate that there’s not a strong separation in the data for these categories.

Next Steps:

Adjust the Number of Clusters: If the clusters don’t appear distinct or are overlapping significantly, consider using an alternative number of clusters and re-evaluate.

Analyze Cluster Characteristics: Beyond visual inspection, analyze the average characteristics within each cluster to gain deeper insights (e.g., average actual_width within each numeric_category cluster).

By studying the cluster plot, you gain insights into the natural groupings within your data and can assess whether the clustering captures meaningful patterns.

#NEXT STEPS:

- Make a cluster analysis of "height"
- Make a cluster analysis of "orifice diameter"
- Make a cluster analysis of "square cm2"

- You must make the cluster analysis on the individual pottery types! So, how does the sizes cluster within each vessel type category???
- then you can answer if one vessel type has more size categories than others!

# Making a cluster analysis of 'orifice diameter', 'width', and 'height'

(chatgpt): For cluster analysis on your archaeological ceramics, I would suggest focusing on all three size variables you mentioned: orifice diameter, total width, and total height. These data points will give you a well-rounded representation of vessel size. Using all three variables for clustering will allow you to identify patterns based on the overall size and shape of the vessels, which could correspond to functional or stylistic categories.

So, your key variables for clustering would be:

- Orifice diameter
- Total width
- Total height
- (Square cm2)

You can standardize these variables if they are on different scales before running the cluster analysis to ensure fair comparison.

It performs hierarchical and k-means clustering using your size measurements.

# Cluster analysis of 'actual width' and 'orifice diameter'

STEP 1: Extract the three numerical categories into one spreadsheet and split the types so 1a becaomes 1

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Install and load necessary libraries
# install.packages("readxl")    # For reading Excel files
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("factoextra") # For visualizing clusters
# install.packages("cluster")

library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(factoextra)
library(cluster)

# Load your dataset from an Excel file
# Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the actual path to your file
ceramics_data <- read_excel("analysis/data/raw_data/data_trial02_trimmed.xlsx")

# Ensure your Excel file has columns: actual_diameter, actual_width, actual_height
# Check the first few rows of your data
#head(ceramics_data)

# Extract numeric part of type_category (e.g., "1a" becomes "1")
ceramics_data_typesplit <- ceramics_data %>%
  mutate(numeric_category = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9]", "", `type_category`)))

# Select the relevant columns for clustering
ceramics_subset <- ceramics_data_typesplit %>%
  select(actual_diameter, actual_width, actual_height, numeric_category) %>%
  na.omit()  # Remove rows with missing values

# Standardize the data (important when variables have different units)
ceramics_scaled <- scale(ceramics_subset)
```

#Elbow plot of 'actual width' and 'orifice diameter'

I will make an elbow plot of 'actual width' and 'orifice diameter' to determine the optimal number of clusters

The plot determines the optimal amount of clusters. To automatically determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, you can use a combination of the elbow plot and the "Kneedle" algorithm, which can help identify the point where the slope of the WSS decreases sharply. However, R does not have a built-in function for this, but we can implement a simple method to find it.

Automatic Optimal 

- k Calculation: The code uses the second derivative of the WSS to identify the optimal number of clusters automatically.
- Elbow Plot with Dashed Line: The elbow plot includes a dashed line indicating the optimal k value.
- Dendrogram: Hierarchical clustering is performed, and the dendrogram is plotted, showing the cut for the optimal number of clusters.

Here's the complete R code that calculates the WSS for different values of k, plots the elbow plot, and automatically determines the optimal number of clusters based on the change in WSS:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# 1. Elbow Plot to Determine Optimal Number of Clusters

# Set a range for k
wss <- numeric(10)  # Pre-allocate a vector for WSS values

for (k in 1:10) {
  kmeans_result <- kmeans(ceramics_scaled, centers = k)
  wss[k] <- kmeans_result$tot.withinss  # Store the WSS for each k
}

# Calculate the rate of change in WSS to find the elbow point
delta_wss <- diff(wss)  # Change in WSS
delta2_wss <- diff(delta_wss)  # Second derivative to find the elbow

# Find the optimal number of clusters where the second derivative is maximum
optimal_k <- which.max(delta2_wss) + 2  # Adding 2 because diff reduces the length by 1

# Create the elbow plot
elbow_plot <- ggplot(data.frame(k = 1:10, WSS = wss), aes(x = k, y = WSS)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = wss[optimal_k], linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +  # Add red dashed line
  labs(title = "Elbow Plot for K-means Clustering of 'actual width' and 'orifice diameter'",
       x = "Number of Clusters (k)",
       y = "Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  annotate("text", x = optimal_k + 0.5, y = wss[optimal_k], 
           label = paste("Optimal k =", optimal_k), color = "red", vjust = -0.5)

# Print the elbow plot
print(elbow_plot)
```
So, my optimal number of clusters for 'actual width' and 'orifice diameter' is 3!

# Hierarchial clustering of 'actual width' and 'orifice diameter'

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# 1. Hierarchical Clustering

# Compute the distance matrix
dist_matrix <- dist(ceramics_scaled, method = "euclidean")

# Perform hierarchical clustering
hc <- hclust(dist_matrix, method = "ward.D2")

# Plot the dendrogram   (RUN TOGETHER WITH CHUNK BELOW!!!)
plot(hc, main = "Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram", xlab = "", sub = "", cex = 0.6)

# Choose the number of clusters (k) by cutting the dendrogram
k <- 3  # You can experiment with different values for k (Elbow plot = 3)
rect.hclust(hc, k = k, border = 2:4)  # Visualize the cut on the dendrogram
```
PRELIM interpretation:

I need to make the data points clearer in the bottom row!

I think it means that I have 3 clusters that start clustering around 20 cm in height? Further interpretation will be conducted when I have cleaned the bottom row

I do not understand what happens when I normalize the data, but I see that my clusters change when I do not do it. My data looks quite strange when I normalize it, so I'm not sure what is the best??

# K-means clustering

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# 2. K-means Clustering

# Perform k-means clustering with the chosen number of clusters
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
kmeans_result <- kmeans(ceramics_scaled, centers = k)

# Add the cluster results to the original data
ceramics_data_typesplit$cluster <- kmeans_result$cluster

# Visualize the clusters using the first two dimensions
fviz_cluster(kmeans_result, data = ceramics_scaled, geom = "point", ellipse = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "K-means Clustering of Ceramics")
```
PRELIM interpretation:

1- My Dim1 (x-axis) conmtrols 83.8% of the clustering variable, and my Dim2 controls 14.9% of the clustering variable. 
2- I have only changed V559 to "16a" and now my dataset looks completely different -> Dim1(62.9%) Dim2(27%) <- I think that my data should not change so much just because I canged one entry in the spreadsheet??

I will continue with these changes for now..

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(cowplot)

# 3. Visualize the clusters with clusters as shapes and vessel types as colors
main_plot <- ggplot(ceramics_data_typesplit, aes(x = actual_diameter, y = actual_width, shape = factor(cluster), color = factor(numeric_category))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Cluster Analysis of Vessel Sizes",
       x = "Orifice Diameter (cm)",
       y = "Total Width (cm)",
       shape = "Cluster",     # Clusters represented by shapes
       color = "Vessel Type") +  # Vessel types represented by colors
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.box = "horizontal"  # Arrange the legends horizontally
  )

# Extract the legends for clusters and vessel types
cluster_legend <- cowplot::get_legend(main_plot + guides(color = "none"))  # Remove vessel type legend
vessel_type_legend <- cowplot::get_legend(main_plot + guides(shape = "none"))  # Remove cluster legend

# Combine the main plot and both legends side by side
final_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(main_plot + theme(legend.position = "none"), 
                                 cowplot::plot_grid(cluster_legend, vessel_type_legend, ncol = 1), 
                                 rel_widths = c(4, 1))  # Adjust relative widths

# Display the final plot
print(final_plot)
```
PRELIM interpretation:

This looks much better than my previous cluster analysis!

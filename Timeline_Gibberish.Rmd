### Cluster analysis but with wrong data ###

# Change the type_cateogry so "1a" becomes "1"

OBS: From here I canged all the names of the datasets so they include "AW" (Actual Width) because I want to make the same cluster analysis with "height", "orifice" and "square cm2"

Extract the Numeric Portion of Type Category: Use regular expressions to isolate the numeric part of each Type category value.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Used library calls:
library(readxl)   # For reading Excel files
library(dplyr)    # For data manipulation
library(stringr)  # For string operations
library(tidyr)    # For missing values operation
library(openxlsx) # For writing Excel files

# Load data
data_trial02_trimmedAW <- read_excel("analysis/data/raw_data/data_trial02_trimmed.xlsx")

# Extract numeric part of type_category (e.g., "1a" becomes "1")
data_trial02_typesplitAW <- data_trial02_trimmedAW %>%
  mutate(numeric_category = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9]", "", `type_category`)))

# View the typeslit dataset (optional)
#head(data_trial02_typesplitAW)

```

You have now created a dataset "data_trial02_typesplitAW" with an extra column named "numeric_category" where the "type_category" has deleted the letter value in the type (i.e. "1a" becomes "1")

# Make cluster analysis of the main "actural_width" category dependent on "type_category"

To analyze clusters of Actual width within each numeric category of the Type category (ignoring the letter part, such as 1a, 1b, 1c grouped as 1), we can split the data by the numeric portion of the Type category and then perform clustering on Actual width measurements within each group. Here’s how to do it:

# Remove 0s but keep NAs of 'actual width' column

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cluster)
library(readxl)

# Remove rows where actual_width is 0 (keeping NAs)
data_trial02_remove0AW <- data_trial02_typesplitAW %>%
  filter(actual_width != 0 | is.na(actual_width))

```

# Prepare the data of the actual width column

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cluster)
library(readxl)

# Data preparation (keep only the "numeric_category" and "actual_width" columns)
data_trial02_prepAW <- data_trial02_remove0AW %>%
  select(numeric_category, actual_width) %>%
  mutate(numeric_category = as.factor(numeric_category))

# Normalize the actual_width (optional but recommended, my data looks very strange if I do this)
#data$actual_width <- scale(data$actual_width, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

# Convert categorical variable to numeric for clustering
data_trial02_numericAW <- data_trial02_prepAW %>%
  mutate(numeric_category = as.numeric(as.character(numeric_category)))

# Remove rows with NA values for clustering
data_trial02_clusteringAW <- data_trial02_numericAW %>%
  filter(!is.na(numeric_category) & !is.na(actual_width))

```

You have now created a dataset (data_trial02_clusteringAW) ready for the cluster analysis, only containing the "numeric_category" and "actual_width" rows and cleaned them from 0s and NAs

# STEP 4: Perform a cluster analysis

To perform a cluster analysis between "numeric_category" and "actual_width" in your dataset (data_trial02_typesplitAW), you can follow these general steps in R:

1)Load Necessary Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary packages installed and loaded. Common packages for clustering include dplyr, ggplot2, and cluster.

2) Data Preparation: Prepare your data by ensuring that both numeric_category and actual_width are in the appropriate format for clustering.

3) Data Normalization: It can be beneficial to normalize your data, especially if the scale of actual_width differs significantly from numeric_category. (ONTE: I found that the normalization did only obscure the dataset)

4) Define how many clusters that are in your dataset

5) Clustering: Choose a clustering method, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to identify clusters.

6) Visualization: Visualize the clusters to see how actual_width relates to numeric_category.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# install and load libraries

#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("cluster")
#install.packages("readxl")

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cluster)
library(readxl)

# Choose a number of clusters (e.g., k = 3 -> you can change this later, but you need to "add cluster assignments back to the original dataset" below)
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
k <- 3
kmeans_resultAW <- kmeans(data_trial02_clusteringAW[, c("numeric_category", "actual_width")], centers = k)

# Add cluster assignments back to the original dataset
# Ensure the cluster assignment only goes to rows without NAs
data_trial02_clusteringAW$cluster <- NA  # Initialize the column with NAs
data_trial02_clusteringAW$cluster[!is.na(data_trial02_clusteringAW$numeric_category) & !is.na(data_trial02_clusteringAW$actual_width)] <- as.factor(kmeans_resultAW$cluster)

# Check that cluster assignments were added correctly
summary(data_trial02_clusteringAW$cluster)

```

OBS: Now you have made a dataset "data_trial02_clusteringAW" that is without all the problems that the previous datasets I had. Use this for the further analysis

# Check to see how many clusters that are in your dataset

To determine the optimal number of clusters for your dataset, you can use methods like the (1) elbow method or the (2) silhouette method. Here’s how to implement each of these methods in R:

1. Elbow Method:
This method involves plotting the total within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) for a range of cluster numbers and looking for the "elbow," where the rate of decrease slows, indicating a good cluster count.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libraries
#library(dplyr)
#library(ggplot2)
#library(readxl)

# Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters
wssAW <- vector("numeric", 10)  # Storage for within-cluster sum of squares

for (k in 1:10) {
  set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
  kmeans_resultAW <- kmeans(data_trial02_clusteringAW[, c("numeric_category", "actual_width")], centers = k)
  wssAW[k] <- kmeans_resultAW$tot.withinss
}

# Plot the elbow curve
plot(1:10, wssAW, type = "b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE,
     xlab = "Number of Clusters",
     ylab = "Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares",
     main = "Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters")

```

The elbow plot helps determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the total within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) for different numbers of clusters. Here's how to interpret it:

Interpreting the Elbow Plot:
Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS): The y-axis represents WSS, which measures the compactness of clusters (lower values mean more compact clusters).

Elbow Point: As the number of clusters increases, WSS generally decreases because each additional cluster reduces the average distance between points and their assigned cluster center. However, there’s a point where adding more clusters no longer significantly improves compactness—this is the "elbow."

Optimal Number of Clusters:

Look for the "elbow" or bend in the plot where the WSS stops decreasing rapidly. This point indicates the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters beyond this point yields only minor improvements.
If the elbow is not clear, alternative methods like the silhouette plot may provide additional guidance.

Key Points to Remember
Distinct Elbow: A clear elbow usually indicates a strong clustering structure in the data.
Gradual Slope: If there's no obvious elbow, it may mean the data does not have a clear clustering structure, or that more advanced clustering techniques may be needed.

INTERPRETATION: I think my elbow is between 4 and 6. Try playing around with either 4, 5, or 6 clusters in the following

# Visualize the cluster plot with automatic optimal amount of clusters

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Install and load necessary libraries
# install.packages("factoextra")  # For visualizing clusters and optimal number

library(ggplot2)
library(factoextra)

# Calculate WCSS for different numbers of clusters (1 to 15)
wcssAW <- numeric()
for (i in 1:15) {
  set.seed(123)
  kmeans_resultAW <- kmeans(data_trial02_clusteringAW[, c("numeric_category", "actual_width")], centers = i)
  wcssAW[i] <- sum(kmeans_resultAW$tot.withinss)
}

# Calculate the optimal number of clusters using the "elbow method" by finding the maximum drop
wcss_diffsAW <- diff(wcssAW)  # First derivative (differences between consecutive WCSS values)
optimal_clustersAW <- which.max(abs(diff(wcss_diffsAW))) + 1  # Find the biggest drop in WCSS

# Elbow plot with the optimal number of clusters marked
elbow_plotAW <- ggplot(data = data.frame(Clusters = 1:15, WCSSAW = wcssAW), aes(x = Clusters, y = WCSSAW)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Elbow Plot for Optimal Clusters of 'actual width'",
       x = "Number of Clusters",
       y = "Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = optimal_clustersAW, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = optimal_clustersAW, y = max(wcssAW), label = paste("Optimal Clusters =", optimal_clustersAW), 
           color = "red", vjust = -1, size = 4)

# Display the plot
print(elbow_plotAW)

```
So my optimal amount of clusters are 2!

# Visualize the cluster plot

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Set new cluster (Adjust k to 2)

set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
kAW <- 2
kmeans_resultAW <- kmeans(data_trial02_clusteringAW[, c("numeric_category", "actual_width")], centers = kAW)

# Add cluster assignments back to the dataset
data_trial02_clusteringAW$cluster <- as.factor(kmeans_resultAW$cluster)

# Visualize the clusters
ggplot(data_trial02_clusteringAW, aes(x = numeric_category, y = actual_width, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Cluster Analysis of 'actual width' by 'vessel type'",
       x = "Vessel type",
       y = "Actual width (cm)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

# Add Cluster Centroids to the plot

Adding cluster centroids to your cluster plot can help you visually identify the "center" of each cluster. Here’s how to modify your code to calculate and add these centroids to the plot:

First, calculate the centroids of each cluster based on the kmeans results.
Then, add these centroid points to the ggplot plot.

Explanation of the Code:

centroids <- as.data.frame(kmeans_result$centers): Extracts the cluster centers as a data frame, so they can be used in ggplot.

centroids$cluster <- as.factor(1:k): Adds a cluster column to the centroids data frame, labeling each centroid by its cluster number.

geom_point(data = centroids, aes(x = numeric_category, y = actual_width), color = "black", shape = 4, size = 5, stroke = 1.5): Adds the centroids to the plot. Here:

shape = 4 uses an "X" shape to distinguish centroids.

size = 5 and stroke = 1.5 make the centroids visually distinct.

This will add black "X" marks to represent the centroids of each cluster on your scatter plot.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Calculate centroids
centroidsAW <- as.data.frame(kmeans_resultAW$centers)  # Extract centers as a data frame
centroidsAW$cluster <- as.factor(1:k)  # Label the clusters

# Visualize clusters with centroids
ggplot(data_trial02_clusteringAW, aes(x = numeric_category, y = actual_width, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_point(data = centroidsAW, aes(x = numeric_category, y = actual_width), 
             color = "black", shape = 4, size = 5, stroke = 1.5) +  # Add centroids
  labs(title = "Cluster Analysis of 'actual width' with Centroids",
       x = "Numeric Category",
       y = "Actual Width") +
  theme_minimal()

```
PRELIM interpretation: 

- I have 2 clusters of 'actual width'
- All my vessel types include cluster 2
- Vessel types 9, 13 and 14 only have cluster 2 and not cluster 1
- The centroids are centered around vessel type 5 (closed vessels). Is this perhaps because this vessel category contains most data points, or is it perhaps because it is the most multi-purpose vessel -> i.e. that it is the "median" of the data set?

# Add a legend to the final cluster plot

Explanation:

- main_plot: Contains your cluster plot with the cluster legend on the right.

- legend_table: A table of x-axis category descriptions.

- legend_plot: A plot version of legend_table using geom_text() to display each category with its description.

- plot_grid(): Combines the main_plot and legend_plot horizontally, placing the main plot on the left and the custom legend on the far right.

- This code will display the cluster plot with the x-axis legend appearing as a labeled table on the far right side. Adjust rel_widths to resize the plot and table as needed.

- plot.margin in both main_plot and legend_plot: Adjusted to reduce space between the plots and bring them closer.

- rel_widths = c(3, 1.2): Increased width allocated to the legend_plot to allow more space for the text.

This should ensure that the full text of each category is displayed. Adjust rel_widths and plot.margin further as needed for the best fit.

```
OK! Now I got my plot to look nice with two legends and the range of my clusters! 

#PRELIM interpretation:

OBS: This interpretation was made with 2 clusters (as is the optimal amount of clusters for "actual width")

- Cluster 1 is between 28 - 97.6 cm
- Cluster 2 is between 4.8 - 27.6 cm
- All my vessel types have cluster 2
- Vessel types 9, 13, and 14 does NOT have cluster 1
- The two centroids are centered around vessel type 5 (closed vessels). Is this because it contains the most data points, or is it because it is the vessel type that is best represented in both clusters?
- Vessel type 5 (closed vessels) has the largest width (surprisingly)
- Vessel type 9 (Vertical vertical-oval vessels) has the smallest width (These are often the "cup"-category also!)
- Vessels 1-5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, and 15 is predominant in cluster 2 (small size cluster)
- Vessels 6 (tightly-closed vessels), 8 (wide-open carinated vessels), and 10 (closed vertical-oval vessels) are predominant in cluster 1 (large size cluster)
- The vessels that cluster in the large size cluster are the storage vessels (for liquids) (cat. 6), serving or frying vessels (cat. 8), and the large storage jars (cat. 10) -> as suspected!!

 
#PRELIM interpretation (OLD01):

OBS: This interpretation was made using 4 clusters!

- Vessel category 5 (closed vessels) is the most numerous and also with a fair spread of all the 4 clusters of vessel width
- Vessel category 4 (vertical vessels) is the second most numerous also containing all the 4 clusters of width, but not so many from cluster 1
- Vessel category 1 (wide open vessels) and 2 (open vessels) are quite the same, but cat. 1 contains less small vessels and cat. 2 contains less larger vessels. As expected!
- Vessel category 7 (Open carinated vessels) are mainly clustering in cat. 3 and 2
- Vessel category 8 (wide-open carinated vessels) does not contain a lot of data, but is mainly clustering in cat. 2
- Vessel category 3 (closed horizontal oval vessels) are mainly clustering in cat. 4
- Vessel category 6 (tightly-closed vessels) are mainly clustering in category 4 and without any small cat. 3 sizes (as expected!)
- Vessel category 9 (vertical-vertical oval vessels) mainly cluster in the lower cat. 3 which is a surprice!
- Vessel category 10 (closed vertical oval vessels) has a nice spread of the clusters (surprise?), but mainly tails towards a higher width/cat. 1-2
- Vessel category 11 (tightly closed vertical oval vessels) does not contain a lot of data, but clusters in cat. 4
- Vessel category 12 are lids so I need to delete this category from the dataset
- Vessel category 13-14 (flasks and bottles) does not have a lot of data, but mainly cluster in the smaller cat. 3 as expected
- Vessel category 15 (Tellem tripods) mainly cluster in the lower cat. 3 as expected
- Perhaps the centroids do not help me a lot??

# STEP ??: Exploring the development of size through time
---------------------------------------------------------

#Q in Chad: 
"I have plotted my vessel in BC and AD terms (example: 250-100 BC, 150-300 AD) and I need to see the development of vessel sizes through time. How do I do this? Shall I change my BC terms in my spreadsheet to -250-100, or how?"

#A from Chad
To analyze the development of vessel sizes through time, it's essential to convert your BC and AD dates into a continuous numerical scale. This ensures that you can plot the data effectively and interpret trends over time. Here's how to handle it:

- 1. Convert BC and AD into a Continuous Scale

BC Dates: Represent BC dates as negative numbers. For example:
250–100 BC → -250 to -100

AD Dates: Represent AD dates as positive numbers. For example:
150–300 AD → 150 to 300

- 2. Adjust Your Spreadsheet

Create two columns in your spreadsheet for the start date and end date of each time range:
For 250–100 BC, enter -250 in the start column and -100 in the end column.
For 150–300 AD, enter 150 in the start column and 300 in the end column.

- 3. Calculate the Midpoint of Each Time Range

Add a new column for the midpoint (average) of the time range:

midpoint = ("start date" + "end date") / 2

For example:
For BC: -250 to -100: Midpoint = (−250+ −100)/2= -175
For AD: 150 to 300: Midpoint = (150+300)/2= 225

This will provide a single value for each vessel's time period, making it easier to analyze trends.

#OBS: All the above has been done, and I have uploaded the results as a spredsheet named "03_timelinedata"

- 4. Visualize Vessel Sizes Through Time

Use the midpoint column as the x-axis (time) and vessel size (e.g., height, diameter, or volume) as the y-axis.

Create a scatter plot, line plot, or boxplot using ggplot2 in R or your preferred plotting tool:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = midpoint, y = vessel_size)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +  # Optional trend line
  labs(title = "Development of Vessel Sizes Over Time",
       x = "Time (Years, BC/AD)",
       y = "Vessel Size") +
  theme_minimal()
```

- 5. Consider Trends

Look for patterns, such as increases or decreases in size over time or abrupt changes during specific periods.

Use color or shapes to differentiate vessel types, rim categories, or other attributes to add depth to the analysis.
